# Digit Classification Neural Network :1234::brain: 

This project focuses on building a handwritten digit classifier using the MNIST dataset. The goal is to create a model capable of correctly identifying the digits (0-9) present in grayscale images. :writing_hand::framed_picture:

## Features and Usage :star::books:

- :books: `Import Libraries:` The code imports necessary libraries for data handling, visualization, and model building.

- :package: `Load and Prepare Data:` The MNIST dataset is loaded and prepared for training and testing.

- :eyes: `Visualize Data:` Sample images are displayed, and the distribution of classes is visualized.

- :straight_ruler: `Normalization:` Data normalization enhances training by scaling pixel values.

- :label: `One-Hot Encoding:` Labels are converted into one-hot encoded vectors for effective model training.

- :brain: `Build Model:` A neural network model is defined with layers for processing.

- :weight_lifting_man: `Train Model:` The model is trained using the training dataset, and loss and accuracy are tracked.

- :bar_chart: `Analyze Performance:` Training and validation loss and accuracy are plotted for analysis.

- :monocle_face: `Evaluate Model:` Model performance is evaluated on both training and testing datasets.
